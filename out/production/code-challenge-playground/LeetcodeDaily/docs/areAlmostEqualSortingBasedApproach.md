# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
This approach is not the most effective but it is straightforward. The goal is to determine whether two strings s1 and s2 are **almost equal**, meaning they can be equal by swapping one pair of characters at most once. The first thing that comes to my mind is to check if the two strings are equal, if they are not equal, then we automatically return false. Otherwise, we proceed by counting the difference. If there are more than two unequal characters in the strings, then we return false

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Sorting and checking Permutation
- Convert both strings to character arrays and sort them.
- If the sorted arrays do not match, then s1 and s2 must have different character frequencies, meaning they can never be made equal with a swap. Return false immediately.
2. Counting Difference
- If the sorted versions match, count how many indices have different characters in s1 and s2
- If there are exactly 2 mismatches, it means we can swap these two mismatched characters to make the strings equal. Return true.
- If there are 0 mismatches, it means the strings are already equal. Return true.
- Otherwise, return false.


# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- Sorting: O(nlogn)
- Comparing sorted arrays: O(n)
- Counting mismatches: O(n)
- Overall complexity: O(nlogn) due to sorting

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
- O(n) due to the two additional character arrays

# Code
```java []
class Solution {
    public boolean areAlmostEqual(String s1, String s2) {
        int c=0;
        char[] s1ChArr = s1.toCharArray();
        char[] s2ChArr = s2.toCharArray();

        Arrays.sort(s1ChArr);
        Arrays.sort(s2ChArr);
        if(!Arrays.equals(s1ChArr, s2ChArr)){
            return false;
        }else{
            for(int i=0; i<s1.length(); i++){
                if(s1.charAt(i)!=s2.charAt(i))
                    c++;
            }
            return c==2 || c==0;
        }

    }
}
```
