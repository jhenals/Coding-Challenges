# Problem Description
You are given a string num representing a large integer. An integer is good if it meets the following conditions:
It is a substring of num with length 3.
It consists of only one unique digit.
Return the maximum good integer as a string or an empty string "" if no such integer exists.

Note:
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
There may be leading zeroes in num or a good integer.

## Example 1:
Input: num = "6777133339"
Output: "777"
Explanation: There are two distinct good integers: "777" and "333".
"777" is the largest, so we return "777".

## Example 2:
Input: num = "2300019"
Output: "000"
Explanation: "000" is the only good integer.
Example 3:

Input: num = "42352338"
Output: ""
Explanation: No substring of length 3 consists of only one unique digit. Therefore, there are no good integers.
 

## Constraints:
3 <= num.length <= 1000
num only consists of digits.

# My Solution:

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
I created an array of character currSubstring that contains a valid substring of num. I parsed this value into an integer and compare to the existing maxSubstring.  If the new valid substring is larger than the existing maxSubstring, then, maxSubstring will be replaced. If not, i will move the current index to i+2 to exclude the valid substring that i previously found. I used a flag emptySubstring and initialized it to true so i can easily return an empty string "" when there is no valid substring in the input

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(n)
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The for loop runs through each character in the input string num (except the last two characters). 
In the worst case, it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
Inside the loop, you perform constant-time operations such as character comparisons, assignments, and conversions. These operations do not depend on the input size and can be considered O(1).
Therefore, the overall time complexity of your method is O(n).

- Space complexity: O(1)
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
The space complexity is determined by the usage of additional data structures or variables in relation to the input size.
You have a constant-size character array currSubstring and a few other primitive variables (e.g., maxSubstring, emptySubstring, currIndex).
The size of these variables remains constant regardless of the input size, so they contribute to O(1) space complexity.
Therefore, the overall space complexity of your method is O(1).

# Code
```
class Solution {
   public String largestGoodInteger(String num) {
    String maxSubstring = "000";
    char[] currSubstring = new char[3];
    boolean emptySubstring = true;
    int currIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < num.length() - 2; i++) {
        currSubstring[0] = num.charAt(i);
        if (num.charAt(i + 1) == currSubstring[0] && num.charAt(i + 2) == currSubstring[0]) {
            currIndex = i + 3;
            currSubstring[1] = num.charAt(i + 1);
            currSubstring[2] = num.charAt(i + 2);
            emptySubstring = false;
            int newSubstring = Integer.parseInt(new String(currSubstring));
            if (newSubstring > Integer.parseInt(maxSubstring)) {
                maxSubstring = Integer.toString(newSubstring);
                
            }
        }
    }
    
    if (emptySubstring) {
        maxSubstring = "";
    }

    return maxSubstring;
}
}
```
